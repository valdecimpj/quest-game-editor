QuestGameEditor is a **work in progress** Angular project envisioned as a tool to create games using a game engine from the same creators, [QuestGameEngine](https://github.com/valdecimpj/QuestGameEngine).
A full documentation on the engine inner workings can be found at [the documentation](https://github.com/valdecimpj/QuestGameEngine/blob/master/README.md), as well as an exemplification of [how to create custom scripts](https://github.com/valdecimpj/QuestGameEngine/blob/master/README.md#custom-scripts-creation).
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.2.
